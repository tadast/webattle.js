In addition to `8080`, if the transport `flashsocket` is enabled, a server will be initialized to listen for requests on port `843`.\n\n### Implementing it on your project\n\n`Socket.IO` is designed not to take over an entire port or Node `http.Server` instance. This means that if you choose to have your HTTP server listen on port `80`, `socket.io` can intercept requests directed to it, and normal requests will still be served.\n\nBy default, the server will intercept requests that contain `socket.io` in the path / resource part of the URI. You can change this as shown in the available options below.\n\nOn the server:\n\n\tvar http = require('http'), \n\t\t\tio = require('./path/to/socket.io'),\n\t\t\t\n\tserver = http.createServer(function(req, res){\n\t\t// your normal server code\n\t\tres.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});\n\t\tres.end('<h1>Hello world</h1>');\n\t});\n\t\n\tserver.listen(80);\n\t\t\t\n\t// socket.io, I choose you\n\tvar socket = io.listen(server);\n\t\n\tsocket.on('connection', function(client){\n\t  // new client is here!\n\t  client.on('message', function(){ … })\n\t  client.on('disconnect', function(){ … })\n\t});\n\t\nOn the client:\n\n\t<script src=\"/socket.io/socket.io.js\"></script>\n\t<script>\n\t\tvar socket = new io.Socket();\n\t\tsocket.connect();\n\t\tsocket.on('connect', function(){ … })\n\t\tsocket.on('message', function(){ … })\n\t\tsocket.on('disconnect', function(){ … })\n\t</script>\n\nThe [client-side](http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io) files are served automatically by `Socket.IO-node`.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Listener\n\n\tio.listen(<http.Server>, [options])\n\t\nReturns: a `Listener` instance\n\t\nPublic Properties:\n\n- *server*\n\n\tAn instance of _process.http.Server_.\n\t\n- *options*\n\n\tThe passed-in options, combined with the defaults.\n\t\n- *clients*\n\t\n\tAn object of clients, indexed by session ID.\n\t\nMethods:\n\n- *addListener(event, λ)*\n\n\tAdds a listener for the specified event. Optionally, you can pass it as an option to `io.listen`, prefixed by `on`. For example: `onClientConnect: function(){}`\n\t\n- *removeListener(event, λ)*\t\n\n\tRemoves a listener from the listener array for the specified event.\n\t\n- *broadcast(message, [except])*\n\n\tBroadcasts a message to all clients. Optionally, you can pass a single session ID or array of session IDs to avoid broadcasting to, as the second argument.\n\t\nOptions:\n\t\n- *resource*\n\n\t\tsocket.io\n\n  The resource is what allows the `socket.io` server to identify incoming connections from `socket.io` clients. Make sure they're in sync.\n  \n- *flashPolicyServer*\n\n\t\ttrue\n\t\t\n\tCreate a Flash Policy file server on port `843` (this is restricted port and you will need to have root permission). If you disable the FlashPolicy file server, Socket.IO will automatically fall back to serving the policy file inline.\n\t\t\n\n- *transports*\n\n\t\t['websocket', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling',\n    'jsonp-polling']\n\t\t\n\tA list of the accepted transports.\n\t\n- *transportOptions*\n\t\n\tAn object of options to pass to each transport. For example `{ websocket: { closeTimeout: 8000 }}`\n\t\n- *log*\n\t\n\t\tƒ(){ sys.log }\n\t\t\n\tThe logging function. Defaults to outputting to `stdout` through `sys.log`\n\nEvents:\n\t\n- *clientConnect(client)*\n\t\n\tFired when a client is connected. Receives the Client instance as parameter.\n\t\n- *clientMessage(message, client)*\n\n\tFired when a message from a client is received. Receives the message and Client instance as parameters.\n\t\n- *clientDisconnect(client)*\n\n\tFired when a client is disconnected. Receives the Client instance as a parameter.\n\nImportant note: `this` in the event listener refers to the `Listener` instance.\n\n### Client\n\t\n\tClient(listener, req, res)\n\t\nPublic Properties:\n\n- *listener*\n\n\tThe `Listener` instance to which this client belongs.\n\n- *connected*\n\n\tWhether the client is connected.\n\t\n- *connections*\n\n\tNumber of times the client has connected.\n\t\nMethods:\n\n- *send(message)*\n\n\tSends a message to the client.\n\t\n- *broadcast(message)*\n\n\tSends a message to all other clients. Equivalent to Listener::broadcast(message, client.sessionId).\n\n## Protocol\n\nOne of the design goals is that you should be able to implement whatever protocol you desire without `Socket.IO` getting in the way. `Socket.IO` has a minimal, unobtrusive protocol layer, consisting of two parts:\n\n* Connection handshake\n\t\n\tThis is required to simulate a full duplex socket with transports such as XHR Polling or Server-sent Events (which is a \"one-way socket\"). The basic idea is that the first message received from the server will be a JSON object that contains a session ID used for further communications exchanged between the client and server. \n\t\n\tThe concept of session also naturally benefits a full-duplex WebSocket, in the event of an accidental disconnection and a quick reconnection. Messages that the server intends to deliver to the client are cached temporarily until reconnection.\n\t\n\tThe implementation of reconnection logic (potentially with retries) is left for the user. By default, transports that are keep-alive or open all the time (like WebSocket) have a timeout of 0 if a disconnection is detected.\n\t\n* Message batching\n\n\tMessages are buffered in order to optimize resources. In the event of the server trying to send multiple messages while a client is temporarily disconnected (eg: xhr polling), the messages are stacked and then encoded in a lightweight way, and sent to the client whenever it becomes available.\n\nDespite this extra layer, the messages are delivered unaltered to the various event listeners. You can `JSON.stringify()` objects, send XML, or even plain text.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt; ([Guille](http://github.com/guille))\n\n- Arnout Kazemier ([3rd-Eden](http://github.com/3rd-Eden))\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
